"Let's assume I'm playing the stock market - buy low, sell high. I'm a day trader, so I want to get in and out of a stock before the day is done, and I want to time my trades so that I make the biggest gain possible.

The market has a rule that won't let me buy and sell in a pair of ticks - I have to wait for at least one tick to go buy. And obviously I can't buy in the future and sell in the past.

So, given a list of stock price ticks for the day, can you tell me what trades I should make to maximize my gain within the constraints of the market? Remember - buy low, sell high, and you can't sell before you buy."
